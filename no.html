        <p>Dear Upama, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to express something that's been on my mind ever since you mentioned not having feelings for me. Though it may not be the response I had hoped for, I want you to know that my feelings for you remain unwavering. I cannot deny the depth of my emotions towards you. You hold a special place in my heart that no one else can fill. Even in the face of adversity, my love for you persists. While I respect your honesty and your feelings, I cannot deny my own truth. I cannot imagine my life without you by my side. Your presence brings me joy and fulfillment in ways I never thought possible. So, regardless of the circumstances, please know that I will always cherish you, Upama. My love for you knows no bounds, and I am here for you, now and always. With love. AND I LOVE YOU (MAYBE ITS LAST TIME U WILL SEE FROM ME)</p>
