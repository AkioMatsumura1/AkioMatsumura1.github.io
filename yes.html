<p>Hey Upama, I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. Seriously, you've had such a huge impact on my life, and I don't even know where to begin. From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. Your kindness, your support, your love - it's all made me a better person. You've been there for me through thick and thin, and I can't thank you enough for that. You have this incredible ability to bring out the best in me. With you by my side, I feel like I can conquer the world. Your smile lights up my day, and your laughter is like music to my ears. I want you to know that I love you more than words can say. You're not just my partner; you're my best friend, my confidante, my everything. I can't imagine my life without you in it. But I also understand that life is unpredictable, and things don't always go according to plan. If there ever comes a time when you find happiness elsewhere, I want you to know that I'll support you no matter what. Your happiness is all that matters to me, even if it means letting you go. Upama, you're an incredible person, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. Here's to many more adventures together, and to a love that lasts a lifetime. With all my love, I love you. </p>
